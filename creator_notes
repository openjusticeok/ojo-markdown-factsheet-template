Fix: \ojotitle
  - A second line in the title will cause the indention to not perform properly
  - Currently using two ~ symbols to create space between the vertical line and text
  - Possible solutions:
    * Try to hard code an indent from the vertical line and text in the preamble
    * Add another \ojotitle line (before the \vspace) for the second line of the title
    
Fix: Header (in black)
  - Make black area go to page edge
  
  
2/8/21 Meeting w/Ryan
  - Text: 
    * Justify text both sides (maybe preamble)
    
  - Body text:
    * Larger font (helps readibility)
    
  - Body Margins
    *In header, try to increase margin
    * Increase margins all around
