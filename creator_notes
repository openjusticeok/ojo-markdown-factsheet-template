Fix: \ojotitle
  - A second line in the title will cause the indention to not perform properly
  - Currently using two ~ symbols to create space between the vertical line and text
  - Possible solutions:
    * Try to hard code an indent from the vertical line and text in the preamble
    * Add another \ojotitle line (before the \vspace) for the second line of the title
